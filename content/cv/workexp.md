        As part of the Theoretical Ecology and Modelling Lab (https://ryanchisholm.com/), I worked on two projects: 1) Determinants of bird diversity on islands across the world, and 2) Undetected extinctions in Singapore. 
        Responsibilities included:
        
        * Created a historical glaciation and sea level map resource (in ArcGIS, QGIS and Python) for simulation input.
        * Ran simulations of spatially-explicit neutral models of biodiversity in Python on High Performance Computing clusters.
        * Managed and collated data, ran empirical analyses (e.g., GLMM, extinction models), and wrote up manuscripts for publication
