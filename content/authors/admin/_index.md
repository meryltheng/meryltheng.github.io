Hello, I'm Meryl, a final-year PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide, Australia. I specialise in quantitative methods & tools including statistics, simulations, and spatial analyses to answer questions about underlying processes. My current research is focused on wildlife monitoring methods and its intersection with movement ecology.

I'm always open to learning from others and to opportunities where I can provide value. Please feel free to reach out if you're interested to connect!

(P.S. I'm also looking for a post-doctoral position in Quantitative Ecology starting 2023. Do reach out!)
